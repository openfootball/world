## What's `football.db`?

A free open public domain football (soccer) database & schema
for use in any (programming) language
(e.g. uses plain text datasets for match schedules, results and more).

## Build Your Own `world.db` Copy

Try in your working folder (that is, `/world`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db`
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.
